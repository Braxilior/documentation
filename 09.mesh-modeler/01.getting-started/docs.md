[TOC]

When you open the Mesh Modeler from the *Title Tools* menu in the menus of a Title Pack.

Once you arrived in the tool, you'll see a basic mesh (a cube) ready to use and the interface.

The interface is divided in three parts: the shape view, the commands available for the current tool (the bar with grey cases) and the tools available (the yellow bar).
