# Create your emblem #
On this tutorial, ***Gimp*** is used to edit an emblem. You can download it [on gimp.org][1], it's free.

The template to create an emblem for the Shootmania shield is available [**here**][2].

Open the template, select the "Team image" layer and place the picture your want here.

# Save correctly your emblem #

In gimp, DDS is not avaiable directly, you have to install the [GIMP-DDS][4] plugin in GIMP. It's only a matter of copying one file.

How to correctly save the file to have the image visible ingame (save it with the `.dds` filetype):

* 512x512
* BC1/DXT1
* no alpha
* with mipmaps
